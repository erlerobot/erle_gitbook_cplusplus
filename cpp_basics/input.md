## Input

Now that we know how to give names to values, we can have the user of the program input
values. This is demonstrated in line 6 below:
```cpp
#include<iostream>
using namespace std;

int main () {
	int x ;
	cin >> x ;
	cout << x / 3 << ' ' << x * 2;

	return 0;
}
 ```
Just as `cout <<` is the syntax for outputting values, `cin >>` (line 6) is the syntax for inputting
values.
