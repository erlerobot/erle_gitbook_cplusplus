## Tokens

Tokens are the minimals chunk of program that have meaning to the compiler – the smallest
meaningful symbols in the language. Our code displays all 6 kinds of tokens, though the
usual use of operators is not present here:

|**Token type**| **Description/Purpose**| **Examples**|
|----|----|----|
|Keywords| Words with special meaning to the compiler |int, double, for, auto |
|Identiﬁers| Names of things that are not built into the language| cout, std, x, myFunction |
|Literals |Basic constant values whose value is speciﬁed directly in the source code |"Hello, world!",24.3, 0, ’c’ |
|Operators |Mathematical or logical oper­ations |+, -, &&, %, << |
|Punctuation/Separators |Punctuation deﬁning the structure of a program |{ } ( ) , ; |
|Whitespace| Spaces of various sorts; ig­nored by the compiler |Spaces, tabs, newlines, com­ments |
